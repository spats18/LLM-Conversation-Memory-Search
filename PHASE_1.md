# Phase 1 — MVP: Paste, Store, Keyword Search

## Goal

Get something **working end to end** before introducing any complexity.

No LangChain yet. No Redis. No embeddings. No AI magic. Just a Spring Boot app that accepts a conversation, stores it, and lets you search it.

This phase is about understanding the **shape of the data** and building the skeleton that every later phase will build on.

---

## What You Will Build

- A Spring Boot REST API with three endpoints
- A PostgreSQL database with two tables
- A simple service that accepts raw conversation text, stores it, and lets you search by keyword
- A minimal summarization step using direct OpenAI API call (no framework — just an HTTP call)

By the end of Phase 1, you can:
1. POST a conversation → it gets stored with a summary
2. GET all conversations → paginated list
3. GET /search?q=your query → keyword match against summaries and content

---

## Why PostgreSQL First (Not Redis)

Starting with PostgreSQL makes the architecture progression deliberate. PostgreSQL's `tsvector` full-text search is keyword-based — it matches exact words. This creates a clear, demonstrable contrast when Redis Vector Store is introduced in Phase 2 with semantic search, which understands meaning rather than just matching tokens.

## Data Model

### Table: `conversations`

```sql
CREATE TABLE conversations (
    id          UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    title       VARCHAR(255),
    source      VARCHAR(50),        -- 'paste', 'url', 'file' (url/file come in Phase 2)
    raw_content TEXT NOT NULL,
    summary     TEXT,
    created_at  TIMESTAMP DEFAULT now(),
    search_vector TSVECTOR           -- PostgreSQL full-text search index
);

CREATE INDEX idx_search_vector ON conversations USING GIN(search_vector);
```

### Table: `conversation_chunks`

```sql
CREATE TABLE conversation_chunks (
    id                  UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    conversation_id     UUID REFERENCES conversations(id),
    chunk_index         INT,
    content             TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at          TIMESTAMP DEFAULT now()
);
```

Why chunks? Because one conversation can be long. You will search at the chunk level in Phase 2 (with embeddings). In Phase 1, the chunk table just stores the raw pieces so you get used to thinking in chunks now.

## API Endpoints

### POST /api/conversations
Accepts a conversation in raw text form. Stores it, generates a summary, indexes it.

**Request body:**
```json
{
  "title": "My conversation about Spring Boot",
  "content": "User: How do I set up Spring Boot?\nAssistant: First, go to start.spring.io..."
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "id": "uuid-here",
  "title": "My conversation about Spring Boot",
  "summary": "A conversation about setting up a Spring Boot project...",
  "createdAt": "2025-04-27T10:00:00Z"
}
```

### GET /api/conversations
Returns a paginated list of all stored conversations with their summaries.

**Query params:** `page`, `size`

### GET /api/conversations/search
Keyword search across summaries and content.

**Query params:** `q` (the search query)

**Response:**
```json
[
  {
    "id": "uuid-here",
    "title": "My conversation about Spring Boot",
    "summary": "A conversation about setting up...",
    "relevanceScore": 0.87
  }
]
```

## Summarization in Phase 1

Make a **direct HTTP call to the OpenAI API** from the Java service. No LangChain. No abstraction. Just `RestTemplate` or `WebClient` calling `https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions`.

This deliberate choice makes the value of LangChain4j's abstraction visible when it's introduced in Phase 2 — you will have already experienced the verbose alternative.

Summarization prompt (Phase 1):
```
Summarize the following conversation in 2-3 sentences.
Focus on the main topic discussed and any conclusions reached.

Conversation:
{raw_content}
```

---

## Chunking in Phase 1

Keep it simple. Split the conversation by `\n\n` (double newline) or every N characters (e.g., 500 characters). Store each chunk in `conversation_chunks`.

You are not doing anything smart with chunks yet. You are just getting used to the concept and making sure the table exists for Phase 2.

## Things to Think About While Building

- How should you handle a conversation that is too long to summarize in one call? (You will solve this in Phase 2 with chunking + LangChain4j, but think about it now)
- What happens if the OpenAI call fails? Should you still store the conversation without a summary?
- What does "keyword search" miss that you wish it could do? (This will be your motivation for Phase 2 semantic search)

---

## Phase 1 Done When...

- [ ] You can POST a raw conversation text and get it stored with a summary
- [ ] You can GET a list of all conversations
- [ ] You can search with a keyword and get relevant results back
- [ ] You understand exactly what each class does and why it exists
- [ ] You can explain the data model and why there are two tables

---

## What Phase 1 Does NOT Do

- No URL fetching (Phase 2)
- No file upload (Phase 2)
- No embeddings (Phase 2)
- No semantic search (Phase 2)
- No agents (Phase 3)
- No Docker (Phase 4)

Resist the urge to add these now. Build the foundation solid first.
